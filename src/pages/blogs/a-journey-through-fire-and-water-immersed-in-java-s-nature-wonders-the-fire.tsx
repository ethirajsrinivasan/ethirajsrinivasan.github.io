    'As shared in my [previous story](/blogs/east-java-wonders-the-water-md/) visiting a volcano is my childhood dream. My journey to the volcanoes had begun and I was filled with so much excitement and anticipation. Before reaching the volcanoes, I explored the beautiful Madakaripura waterfall on my way. My first day at the Madakaripura waterfall went so well. I was so much satisfied. The cascading waters amidst the green surroundings were awe-inspiring. A perfect beginning to my volcanic adventure.',

With so much enthusiasm, I was looking forward to the days ahead. In this story, I am going to continue sharing my journey to the volcanoes of Java Island. If you wish to know how it all began, check out the following story.

## The Unexpected Surprise

After returning from the waterfalls we started our journey at about 7 PM. We managed to get some buns and cakes at a local shop and it was delicious, especially the chocolate-flavored ones. At about 11 pm we reached our destination, stepping foot on Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. We were welcomed with a cold, freezing night. We quickly refreshed and started to walk through the street to have our dinner. It was midnight and we were walking in the middle of the road. When I looked at the sky I was so much delighted to see the stars shining like a diamond. It was a beautiful sight. It made me feel calm and rejuvenated my spirit. Later I came to know that Mount Bromo is one of the finest destinations for astrophotography due to its high elevation and remote location offering excellent conditions to capture the glorious Milky Way. With the bright stars shining above I came to bed to start afresh the next day.

The Milky Way At Mount Bromo

## The Tengger Caldera Volcanoes

With so much excitement we woke up early in the morning at 3 AM. We took a Jeep and started our journey. We were joined by many other jeeps to Mount Penanjakan. The jeep convoy through the dark with the hilly bumpy ride made it so adventurous. We reached the top of Mount Penanjakan. We quickly moved to a viewpoint. From the dark night, the sun began to rise slowly. It painted the sky with a breathtaking display of colors. During those few minutes, my eye witnessed the true display of natural colors. It burst into shades of blue, pink, yellow, and orange. With the viewpoint offering an unparalleled panorama of Mount Bromo Volcano, the volcanoes stood majestically against the colored sky. What a way to view my first sight of a volcano in my lifetime. And it was not just one volcano but five. It is the Tengger Caldera consisting  of Mount Bromo (2,329 m), Mount Batok (2,470 m), Mount Kursi (2,581 m), Mount Watangan (2,661 m), and Mount Widodaren (2,650 m). A moment to cherish forever. After capturing the scenic beauty we began to travel down the Mount Penanjakan to Mount Bromo.

## The Mount Bromo

Hiking down Mount Penanjakan we reached the Sea of Sand. It is a desert of black sand between Mount Penanjakan and the active Bromo volcano. I reached the foot of Mount Bromo. Yes, I have stepped foot on an active volcano and my heart felt light. We began to ascend to the crater rim. As we reached halfway to the top I could smell the sulfur in the air and the volcano pushing the smoke to the sky. On reaching the top I saw the eye of the crater. The view was absolutely breathtaking. I took a few minutes to watch the crater and absorb the energy of the volcano that had captived me for so long.

## The Journey Continues

With so much satisfaction I descended the mountain and reached our hotel. My journey does not stop here and an exciting next day was waiting for me. Stay tuned for the last day of my journey.
