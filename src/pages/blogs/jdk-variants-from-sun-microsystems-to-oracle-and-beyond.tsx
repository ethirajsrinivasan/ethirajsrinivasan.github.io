In 2010, Oracle Corporation, another technology company, acquired Sun Microsystems, including its Java-related assets, as part of a business acquisition. This included the ownership of Java, including its intellectual property, trademarks, copyrights, and other related assets.

After the acquisition, Oracle became the new owner and steward of Java, taking over the responsibility for its development, maintenance, and support. Oracle continued to invest in Java, providing updates, enhancements, and new versions of the Java platform, including the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

Since then, Oracle has been actively involved in the development and evolution of Java, contributing to the Java Community Process (JCP) and providing leadership in shaping the future direction of Java. Oracle has also been responsible for the distribution of Oracle JDK, which is one of the widely used distributions of the JDK.

As of April 16, 2019, Oracle changed its licensing and distribution model for the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which includes Oracle JDK. This change was implemented with the release of JDK 11, and subsequent versions of Oracle JDK, where Oracle implemented a new release cycle and support model for Java.

Oracle JDK is no longer free for commercial use primarily due to the following reasons:

- **Oracle's business model**
- **Shifting focus to long-term support (LTS) releases**
- **OpenJDK as the open-source alternative**

**Oracle's business model:** Oracle, like many other technology companies, generates revenue from licensing and support services. By making changes to the licensing and distribution model of Oracle JDK, Oracle aimed to monetize and generate revenue from their Java offerings, particularly for commercial use.

**Shifting focus to long-term support (LTS) releases:** With the introduction of the new release cycle and support model, Oracle shifted its focus to Long-Term Support (LTS) releases, which are designated every three years. LTS releases receive extended support and updates for a longer duration compared to non-LTS releases. As part of this change, Oracle made updates and patches for older JDK versions, including JDK 8 (which was previously free for commercial use), available only to customers with a commercial support subscription.

**OpenJDK as the open-source alternative:** Oracle actively supports and contributes to the OpenJDK project, which is the open-source reference implementation of the Java SE platform. OpenJDK is available under an open-source license, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), which allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the software. Oracle encourages users to use OpenJDK as a free and open-source alternative to Oracle JDK for commercial use.

It's important to note that while Oracle JDK is no longer free for commercial use, there are other alternatives available, such as OpenJDK, which is widely used and supported by the Java community. Additionally, some other companies and organizations, such as Amazon with their Amazon Corretto JDK, offer free, open-source distributions of the JDK that can be used for commercial purposes. It's crucial to review and comply with the licensing and usage terms of each JDK distribution to ensure compliance with their respective licensing policies. Lets looks about more about the following JDKs.

- Oracle JDK
- OpenJDK
- Amazon Corretto
- AdoptOpenJDK (Eclipse Temurin)
- Zulu JDK
- GraalVM
