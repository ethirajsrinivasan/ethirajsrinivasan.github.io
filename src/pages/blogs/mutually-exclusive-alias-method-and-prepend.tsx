  excerpt:
    '\`Module#alias_method\` was one of the earliest solution to overwrite a method in ruby. With an alias method in place you can redefine a method to anything you want and call the old method using the alias_method.',

  content: `Let us consider the following example:

\`\`\`ruby
class Person
 def greeting
  puts "Hello"
 end
end

class Person
  def greeting_with_expression
    puts "Hi,Hello"
    greeting_without_expression
  end

  alias_method :greeting_without_expression, :greeting
  alias_method :greeting, :greeting_with_expression
end
\`\`\`

In the example above \`Person#greeting\` is overridden using alias method. \`greeting_without_expression\` calls the actual greeting method.

With the advent of \`Module#prepend\` in Ruby 2.0 it allows you override a method in a class with a method from a module, and still access the class's implementation with super:

\`\`\`ruby
module Greeting
  def greeting
    puts "!!! Hello"
    super
  end
end

Person.prepend(Greeting)
\`\`\`

Greeting module is prepended to Person. And now when you call:

\`\`\`ruby
Person.new.greeting
\`\`\`

You will end up with:

\`\`\`text
SystemStackError: stack level too deep
\`\`\`

What happened on the background is that \`Greeting#greeting\` was called at first then it calls its super_method(\`Person#greeting_with_expression\`). At the end of execution of greeting_with_expression it calls the greeting_without_expression method which again calls \`Greeting#greeting\` due to method lookup. This creates a deadlock situation and results in stack level too deep error.

Learning from the above example is that you will not be able to combine \`Module#prepend\` and \`Module#alias_method\`. You can follow only one of these method if you want to overwrite a method at multiple levels.

Lookup for alias method and prepend when you come across stack level too deep error next time. Happy Coding !!!`,
